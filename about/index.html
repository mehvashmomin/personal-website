		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>I'm a huge skier (certified austrian skiing instructor) and love being out in the mountains in winter. 9am sharp, -5˚C outside, drawing the first lines into some fresh powder – that's where I love to be.</p>

		<p>I am also a big specialty coffee geek (SCAE certified barista) and have my own prosumer-grade <span class="mouseover" title="La Spaziale Mini Vivaldi II">espresso machine</span> and <span class="mouseover" title="Mazzer Mini with Super Jolly burrs">grinder</span> at home. I don't want to miss starting my day with a good cup of coffee.</p>
